# Wraith Framework

The Wraith framework is written for Vulkan using glfw and Dear ImGUI to provide the basic widget functionality.  The 
goals of the framework are to allow for the creation of desirable, pleasantly ergonomic, cross platform graphical 
applications with all of the rich functionality users might want.  Nearly all applications need to have settings, key
bindings, menus, panels, dialogs, etc.  The idea of Wraith is to make it possible to build 3d experiences with 2d 
interaction, allowing for data visualization tools, development tools, 3d graphics tools.

The approach we are taking is; What if I wanted to write Blender without having to build the whole UI from scratch in 
OpenGL or Inkscape in a fast cross platform way that compiles natively without dependencies on X11, or fSpy without 
depending on electron?

The ultimate intent of Wraith is to facilitate development of fast, capable, graphically rich native applications.
